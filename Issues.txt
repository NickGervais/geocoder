Here are some issues that I ran into along the way and how I worked around them:

1) First Issue I ran into:
# ran into issues with the geocoder returning weird latitude and longitude cordinates 
# this occured when you only search for a city and not a full address
# work around for this that I found was to change the 'key' parameter in the url from '+CA&key=' to '+USA&key='
# this puts the searched city or address in the reference of the whole USA instead of just California

2) Second Issue I ran into:
# when trying to extract the place id, latitude, and longitude from the recieved json data,
# I was trying to get it by doing json['results']['place_id'],
# however, I did not realize that the 'results' object within the json was an array
# the solution for this is to instead extract it  by doing json['results'][0]['place_id']
# which grabs the first index of results, which seems to be the important index with all the information in it.

3) Third Issue I ran into:
# I had issues with the different libraries such as 'requests' and 'urllib', and how they ran on python2 versus python3
# And also issues with running these libraries on windows versus linux
# The request Library seems to work on windows and linux but only on python2
# And I had troubles running the urllib library on any system
